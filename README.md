# QuakeLab
QuakeLab is a lightweight web app that allows users to input key fault displacement metrics and predict the corresponding earthquake magnitude using a trained machine learning model. Built with Streamlit and Plotly, this tool offers interactive maps and visualizations using real data from the Southern California Earthquake Center (SCEC).
